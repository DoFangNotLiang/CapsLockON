# CapsLockON
Small tray icon application that let's you know if your caplock and numlock is on or off. -- 
Made during 1. semester in my Computer Science class.

______________________________________
This is a tray application app.
It will sit in the tray with 2 icons - 1 for capslock and 1 for numlock.
The icons will switch between ON and OFF indicating if the buttons are toggled.

The Program runs in an infinite while-loop and is on a 1 second threadSleep.

Made because my new laptop DOESN'T have an indication wether those are on or off. Seriously. Why? -.-

You can add the program to your startup menu, so it starts up when you turn on your PC.

Made during the early part of the 1. semester in my Computer Science class, so even though the program works as expected,
it could probably have been made more beautiful.
